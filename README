The app allows you to change the color of your system's LEDs (the power light) and also keep it changed on the XMB or while playing games/homebrews. 
This is NOT permanent; the first time that you turn off your PS3, the led will go back to normal

This version does NOT need any kind of external drive. all you need is a JoyPad; just it.

Now the app is Lighter (from ~1.2 Mb to ~145Kb), Faster, for all TVs (HD/SD) and Easier to use.

CHANGELOG:

initial release (1.0):
* it uses another app font.

1.1:
* corrected few errors, added not found device, added correct font path

2.0
* Made some awsome updates, now it uses directly RSX.
